              <p>
                  With yearly releases of Marvel films, it's getting harder to keep track of the events that are happening to viewers that just started on later movies such Thor: Love and Thunder (2022).
                  It may be hard to stay invested on a movie franchies that started a long time ago (Iron Man (2008)) much more following the canonical timeline (Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)) and as such provides a barrier for new Marvel fans to enjoy and make sense on what is happening on what they are watching and on the timeline as a whole. 

                  This site is made for the purpose of helping those who are confused on the canonical timeline of the MCU and to catalogue them in order.
